# Gulpfile generator
I love _using_ Gulp. Writing gulpfiles, though? Not so much. 

This is a script written in Python that will take a YAML configuration file and generate a gulpfile for you. 

To run it, it's best that you add the script (**gulpgenerator**) to your PATH. It will look in the current working directory for a **gulpconfig.yaml** file and then generate the gulpfile accordingly.

**This is still under construction. Please feel free to add modules, add improvements, or suggest features etc.**
